We confirmed Kaling “liked” both of the additional tweets, prior to one of the tweets being deleted by its author. A screengrab of the two additional tweets Kaling liked was shared by a Twitter user who said, “Seems like it was a mistake since she hasn’t liked it anymore and has now liked tweets in opposition of JK.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Seems like it was a mistake since she hasn’t liked it anymore and has now liked tweets in opposition of JK. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CzUwew0xUD</a></p>— Fix Your Tie (@Nathan_VBB) <a href=#>October 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=false>Kaling, who is a showrunner for the forthcoming Scooby-Doo spinoff, Velma, has yet to publicly acknowledge the incident, beyond liking related tweets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6qrrDsmSkmZyeu6h5yWaiZqqfrLmqusZmmKecXanEqsDTnqlmnaaav7rAx6KloGWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ex-border-agent-anthony-burgos-aviles-murder-trial.html><span>←</span><span>Ex-border agent Anthony Burgos-Aviles murder trial</span></a>
