Nobody was expecting Tears of the Kingdom to run at a locked 60 FPS, though it seems that it often slips below the targeted 30 FPS when the action heats up. That said, Breath of the Wild suffered similar issues and that hasn’t stopped it from topping many ‘greatest game of all time’ lists, so we don’t expect it to be a major factor going forward.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>What’s clear is that Nintendo has taken the incredible foundation set by Breath of the Wild and expanded on it in many fascinating ways. We can’t wait to get out there and explore this wonderful open world for ourselves.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, May 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXaGyqLHNnWSonl2vsq2wwGarnpmiqHqwsoytn55lm567qLDOpmSmnaSWsLO106KaZqqRqbavs4yapZ1loprDqrHWrGSaqpVis6q6wKWjsmWYmr%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-last-of-us-why-does-kathleen-want-to-kill-henry.html><span>←</span><span>The Last of Us: Why does Kathleen want to kill Henry?</span></a>
