Three years after the conclusion of Game of Thrones, HBO is bringing back our favorite fantasy series in the guise of a prequel.&nbsp;Set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon introduces a slew of fresh actors to chronicle the Targaryens’ narrative. House of the Dragon will recount the origin tale of the House of the Dragon, better known as the Targaryens, and will be directed by Miguel Sapochnik and RJ Condal, who will also serve as executive producers with George RR Martin, Vince Gerardis, Sarah Lee Hess, and Ron Schmidt.</p><h2>What role does Matt Smith play in House of the Dragon?</h2><p>Matt Smith is a well-known English actor who made his television debut in Sally Lockhart’s Mysteries: The Ruby in the Smoke. However, he rose to notoriety when producer Steven Moffat cast him as the eleventh Doctor in the renowned BBC sci-fi adventure series Doctor Who (2005). He featured in 49 episodes of Doctor Who before departing during the series’ historic 50th anniversary year. For his work in the BBC series, Matt Smith was nominated for a National Television Award in the category of Outstanding Drama Performance. He was also nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Matt-Smith-2.jpg alt="Matt Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Smith’s most recognized role after Doctor Who was in the Netflix royal drama The Crown, where he played Prince Philip for the first two seasons. In 2018, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance.&nbsp;Matt Smith has appeared in a number of films, including Patient Zero, Sony’s Spider-Man spin-off Morbius, and Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho.</p><p>He also appeared in the short films Together, Womb, and Terminator Genisys.&nbsp;Smith will portray Daemon Targaryen, Viserys’s brother, in House of the Dragon. Daemon is a fierce warrior and dragon rider who aims to take his brother’s reign after his death.&nbsp;It is unclear if Daemon is a hero or a villain in the novel, but he is a slightly unstable guy who wields the legendary Valyrian steel blade, Dark Sister. Don’t pass over Matt Smith as the Targaryen prince in House of the Dragon.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Matt-Smith-3.jpg alt="Matt Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What exactly is the House of the Dragon all about?</h2><p>House of the Dragon, set two centuries before the Game of Thrones plot centers on the Dance of the Dragons, an internal civil war among the Targaryens.
