In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, O’Neill opened up about the ins and outs of crafting one of the show’s deeper characters, noting the emotional depths he was required to delve into this upcoming season, all without abandoning the ethos of the show.</p><p>“He understands what love is and whom he’s in love with. Physically it’s been quite demanding, and also emotionally it’s been quite demanding to be playing a man enraged by unrequited love, who’s basically a hopeless romantic, and to be able to play all that and also remember that this is fundamentally a comedy.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>Indeed, it will be interesting to see just how much further Izzy will go in season two, given the character’s already kinetically combative attitude that gels so explosively with their relationship to love and friendship, and he’s but just one piece of the Our Flag Means Death puzzle — a puzzle whose essence few shows will ever hope to capture again.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>Our Flag Means Death is available to stream on Max.
