So those hungry for the super-spy’s return are entertaining themselves by pitching some intriguing, left-field choices for the role.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Forget the Idris Elbas and Henry Cavills — as good as both of those actors, and the other more obvious picks for the part, would be, maybe what the franchise needs next is to go for someone a little bit more unexpected. Although it’s hard to remember now, Daniel Craig was seen as a shocking hire back in the mid-aughts, and now he’s many people’s favorite Bond of them all. So sometimes it really pays to take a risk. But do any of these actors have a decent shot of driving the Aston Martin next? Let’s take a look…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Taylor Zakhar Perez</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>*Henry just walks into the room with that James Bond look*<br>Alex:<a href=#>https://t.co/PDOYppdpWS</a></p>— “I'm gonna die alone.”💔 (@Myriam221b) <a href=#>August 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>We’re more than up for a person of color playing Bond, but although Taylor Zakhar Perez’s debonair turn as Alex in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video romcom Red, White, & Royal Blue</a> showed us he’d look the part, the fact that he’s American not British is a strike against him. But then George Lazenby was Australian, so who knows?</p><h2 id=h-nicholas-galitzine data-injectable=false>Nicholas Galitzine</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=pt dir=ltr>ele é filho do James Bond!! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tB1zBtOda6</a></p>— Malu 📚🍂 (@willesblue) <a href=#>August 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Perez’s Red, White, & Royal Blue co-star Nicholas Galitzine is a native Englishman, however, so he’s maybe more primed to sip on Bond’s martinis instead. His youthful looks might make you think he’s not experienced enough for the part, but he’s actually 28, so could be in his early 30s by the time a new movie rolls around.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Cameron Monaghan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone cast him as James Bond please <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Cx2kPg7o5Y</a></p>— Jilly (@Jillerina159) <a href=#>August 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>OK, let’s for a moment run with the hypothetical that producers ARE willing to cast an American as Bond. In which case, Cameron Monaghan would be a neat choice. He’s a talented, chameleonic actor who seems dedicated to gobbling up franchises like skittles (Star Wars, DC, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jonathan Bailey</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Make Jonathan Bailey James Bond and let him be a chaotic bisexual. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7M0mKlyLn0</a></p>— Karen Huger’s CVS Shoes (@spicykezzinnugg) <a href=#>August 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>The Bridgerton heart-throb is clearly about to own the big screen as he already owned the small one, as he’s due to play <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the male lead in the two-part Wicked movie adaptation</a>.

Tom Ellis is synonymous with Lucifer Morningstar to millions of viewers across the globe, so he definitely needs a major movie role as another iconic character to undo that typecasting.
