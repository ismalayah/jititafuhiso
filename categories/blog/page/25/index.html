<a href=../../../../rebecca-yarros-controversy-explained.html></a>
Move over, J.K. Rowling, a new controversial fantasy author is sweeping in to steal your throne.
Recommended Videos I kid — Rebecca Yarros isn’t nearly as bad as Rowling, but she does seem to be in the hot seat a lot these days. Far from Rowling’s transphobic rhetoric, however, Yarros’ controversy stems from a far less hateful —&nbsp;but still damaging — place. It all revolves around the author’s mega-popular Empyrean series of books, which released its first two parts in 2023.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Very Good Girls movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../very-good-girls-2014.html></a>
Once upon a time, there was a 1980 teen comedy called "Little Darlings." It raised some eyebrows and ignited certain libidos by pitting two of the most popular young actresses around—Tatum O’Neal of "Paper Moon" and Kristy McNichol of TV’s "Family"—in a race to lose their virginity first while attending summer camp.
The premise, thankfully, wasn’t nearly as tawdry as it sounded. And the stars—especially McNichol, bestowed with gifts beyond her years—were able to bring out some dramatic truth in their pursuit of deflowering.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Are the new Snow White live-action remake pictures real?

Snow White is supposedly the latest live-action Disney remake, and filming is underway — at least, that’s the word on the street as photos from filming have appeared online, but are the pictures real?
Recommended Videos The photos purportedly came from on set this Thursday as The Daily Mail shared an “exclusive” behind-the-scenes glimpse of the film. They show Snow White dressed in her recognizable dress and cape. She’s also accompanied by her band of seven dwarves.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jim Carrey And Jeff Daniels Ride A Deer In Dumb And Dumber To Image</h2><time>Jun 27, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos When you choose to title a sequel with a common grammatical error that is neither funny nor particularly clever, then you’re setting the bar pretty low. But the bar was already low for&nbsp;Dumb and Dumber To,&nbsp;so there’s not much farther that it could sink. Starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprising their roles as Lloyd and Harry from the first Dumb and Dumber,&nbsp;Dumb and Dumber To&nbsp;is pretty much set up to be…dumb.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Was Tanner in the right to date another woman on Kats birthday?

Bachelor Nation fans might be watching the most chaotic season of the already-often-messy spinoff, Bachelor in Paradise, and that point was hit home last night as Katherine Izzo anticipated a thrilling birthday celebration, but was instead left singing lyrics to Filter’s iconic song: “one is the loneliest number that you’ll ever know.”
Recommended Videos Izzo woke up with a glimmer of joy in her eyes as she proclaimed that it was her birthday, and she was looking forward to a beautiful day with Tanner.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>This is Not Okay: Ice-Ts Wife Coco Austin Defends 7-Year-Old Daughter Twerking In a Family</h2><time>Jun 26, 2024</time>

The New York Times is a venerable player in the world of newspaper word games, its daily crossword puzzle long considered the gold standard. But the Times’ recent acquisition of Wordle at a rumored seven-figure price caused controversy and concern among the popular word-guessing game’s millions of fans; some accused the paper of making Wordle harder, despite evidence to the contrary, and others worried that the game might slide behind a paywall.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MODOK concept art reveals an alternate look for the polarizing Quantumania debutant</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was far from a cinematic disaster, but it’s safe to say Marvel Studios won’t be over the moon with its reception. The Ant-Man sequel is now sitting at 47% on the Tomatometer, meaning it’s tied for the ignominious honor of worst-reviewed MCU movie with Eternals. Quantumania has also stumbled at the box office — $450 million is nothing to sniff at, but it pales in comparison to recent MCU hits.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Are Melissa and Joe Gorga still married?</h2><time>Jun 24, 2024</time>
