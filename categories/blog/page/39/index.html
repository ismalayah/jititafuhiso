Recommended Videos It was&nbsp;two years ago, while reviewing I Spit On Your Grave 2, that I found myself questioning&nbsp;why the hell someone thought&nbsp;Meir Zarchi’s sexploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave (1978) would be the perfect jumping point for a torturous franchise based on dirty, genital-mutilating vengeance. Yet, despite my deepest fears, here we are discussing I Spit On Your Grave 3: Vengeance Is Mine, which is a much less powerful and far more disgusting take on a message that this year’s Felt handled with much more poise, artistry, and grace.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Booker T Wasnt Upset About Being Drafted To SmackDown Over RAW: It Gave Me A Chance To Be At E</h2><time>May 9, 2024</time>

The 2021 WWE Draft has just wrapped up and the latest episode of the ‘Hall of Fame’ podcast saw&nbsp;Booker T&nbsp;look back and explain why he preferred to go to SmackDown over Monday Night RAW in the 2004 draft. That year’s draft saw Booker cut a heel promo on then-SmackDown General Manager Kurt Angle about not being happy about coming to the “minor leagues” of SmackDown, but he says it was just for TV and it was the complete opposite feeling in real life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A polarizing sci-fi horror that was blasted and bombed remains capable of stirring the pot</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>

As far as sci-fi horror goes, there are very few movies to have ever entered the same stratosphere as Ridley Scott’s Alien, which set the benchmark over 40 years ago and has arguably yet to be surpassed. However, depending entirely on who you ask, there’s a chance you’ll find at least somebody stating a case for 2009’s Pandorum.

Link is the hero of The Legend of Zelda, but the franchise’s heart lies in the titular character, Princess Zelda. It’s been 36 years since the first game dazzled NES owners, setting a rock-solid action/puzzle adventure template that’s been endlessly iterated on over multiple generations. Just as the games have evolved, so has Princess Zelda. The damsel-in-distress stereotype is subverted more often than not, with each game presenting a distinct yet familiar take on the wielder of the Triforce of Wisdom.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>ToolsTicks and Leeches Lyrics</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>

Suck and suck.
Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck.
Workin up under my patience like a little tick.
Fat little parasite.
Suck me dry.
My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards.
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue.
Hope this is what you wanted.
Hope this is what you had in mind.
Cuz this is what you’re getting.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What age is Antoine Dupont? What height is Antoine Dupont?</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>
