This choice was apparently made to avoid the outrage directed toward the remake from popular figures such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of Thrones</a> actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Dinklage</a>, who described the idea as “[freaking] backwards” on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>“You’re progressive in one way and you’re still making that [freaking] backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together.”</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>He has a good point, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney would benefit from heeding his words.</a> So, maybe these production photos are real? Or maybe it’s bait. The article definitely seems happy to bash the film for being “woke” (because apparently, that’s a bad thing).</p><h2 id=h-are-the-pictures-real data-injectable=false>Are the pictures real?</h2><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Aside from the pics shared by The Daily Mail, there isn’t really a lot to go off of. And the photos themselves aren’t exactly concrete confirmation that this is, in fact, from the real film — they’re probably not real at all.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>First off, let’s start with the fact that the photos come from the set while the cast was filming on Thursday, July 13. This was mere hours before the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike</a> effectively put a halt to all productions. While they could have got a few scenes in, there’s no way filming could continue even if this were to be true.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Secondly, the actress pictured is not <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Zegler,</a> who has been confirmed to play the part of Snow White. The Daily Mail insists that it is a “stand-in” for the main actress. I don’t know about you, but that sounds kind of fishy to me.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Lastly, and most definitively of all, Disney itself has come out and stated that these photos are fake. Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Beast</a>, who asked the company to comment on the leaked photos, a spokesperson for the company had this to say:</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>“The photos are fake and not from our production. We are currently trying to have the Daily Mail issue a correction.”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=false>So, we have our answer, straight from the horse’s mouth. No, these photos aren’t from behind the scenes of the upcoming remake. Perhaps we’ll get to see some real production photos soon, but this ain’t it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKudXam1pnnNnq5mq56kxG7Dx6KrnmWcnsOmecCcq6KnnmK%2FprnApJxmqJmYwba%2BxKxkq52RoXq1tMRmqa6ln6fAbrHXqaOaoZ6asXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./very-good-girls-2014.html><span>←</span><span>Very Good Girls movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</span></a>
