According to the band’s official Instagram, they are postponing the show due to a vague statement of sickness. Though no further details came to light, many fans on social media surmised that incendiary frontman Axl Rose could be fatigued from how physical the shows are.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Guns N' Roses (@gunsnroses)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Refunding the fans is the best-case scenario when it comes to postponing shows. Often, it can be near impossible to recoup any losses when it comes to large stadium events. But irate fans online may also be nursing a different kind of wound. It will be a long time before Missouri fans are likely to forget the famous incident that occurred in 1991.</p><h2 id=h-riverport-riot data-injectable=false>Riverport riot</h2><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>2023 wasn’t the first time that Guns N’ Roses returned to St. Louis since that fateful day in the early ‘90s, but it wasn’t that far off. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a> reported that 2017 was the first time the band returned after the notorious riot that occurred because of a contraband camera. The incident didn’t take place at Busch Stadium but at the nearby Riverport Amphitheater, which has now been renamed the Hollywood Casino Amphitheater.</p><p data-characters=727 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>After almost an entire set, Rose became enraged at a fan wielding a camera. What must he think in the current era where everyone has a camera attached to their phone? At the time, he wasn’t too happy about it and started yelling at the fan. Before security could intercede, Rose dove into the audience, effectively ending the show. As the band made it clear that they would no longer be playing, a violent riot ensued, leading to 65 people injured. Rose did not get out clean and was fined and found guilty of misdemeanor assault for his role in the incident. Typical of the inflammatory musician, Rose was not quick to apologize. In fact, “F–k you, St. Louis!” was more or less the party line when it came to the show.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>It can’t be said that this is necessarily what drove Rose into a bout of alleged sickness for the 2023 tour, but it is an interesting coincidence. At least in this decade, there appears to be less property damage and more respect for the fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46hmKxll6q7tHnNZqmoq5WoeqStzZycpZ2UYsGpscirZGtoYmh6pLvNnJyrrF2eu26%2F02ajqK2ZqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-age-is-antoine-dupont-what-height-is-antoine-dupont.html><span>←</span><span>What age is Antoine Dupont?
