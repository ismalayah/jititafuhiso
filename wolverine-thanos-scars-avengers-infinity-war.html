Back in December, it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney had acquired 20th Century Fox</a>, thereby bringing the rights to the X-Men back to Marvel Studios. Given that, it’s expected that Wolverine and the rest of Xavier’s team will be integrated into the MCU at some point in Phase Four.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=false>And, if they decide to take the route that the X-Men have always been there, just out of sight, then it’s potentially possible that Wolverine really is responsible for giving Thanos his scars. For example, Spider-Man didn’t return to Marvel until 2016, but it was retroactively agreed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the boy who Tony Stark saves in 2010’s&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Man 2</a>&nbsp;was Peter Parker. So basically, hold on to that fan theory, guys, as one day it might become canon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqikppq%2FqrrEZquhmZ6kwG6%2FwpqprGWRq7Kvs8Srqmahnpu2r7XTsmSwmaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-big-green-ugly-franchise-is-about-to-have-its-logan-moment-and-hugh-jackman-and-mark-ruffalo-are-nowhere-to-be-seen.html><span>←</span><span>Hugh Jackmans Logan is still sending shockwaves through Hollywood as a smaller, furrier suc</span></a>
