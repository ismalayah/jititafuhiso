There were a few main roster surprises, as fans should expect from NXT at this point, but the brand brought a lot more homegrown action as well. How did the viewership turn out?</p><p><a href=#>Sports TV Ratings</a> reports that the October 17th episode of WWE NXT brought in a viewership of 798,000, with a .23 in the 18 to 49 demographic.</p><p>This week’s episode saw a storyline with Trick Williams, where he was injured and taken to the hospital during the show. That was caused by a backstage attack, because someone wasn’t happy about him being in the fatal four-way #1 contender’s match, a match that Carmelo Hayes won. <a href=#>The night was also closed out by Jade Cargill</a>, which was a big surprise.</p><p><a href=#>Natalya also showed up this week on NXT</a>&nbsp;to stand in Tegan Nox’s corner as she faced Lyra Valkyria. That match did not end the way Nox wanted it to, <a href=#>as Chelsea Green and Piper Niven</a> showed up to interfere. That was not all, <a href=#>because Akira Tozawa was also on NXT</a>. This week was full of moments we didn’t see coming, as the NXT brand continued to produce newsworthy moments.</p><p>WWE spent a majority of this week’s NXT episode setting up for <a href=#>next week’s Halloween Havoc Night 1 special</a>. The main event also went on to help determine who would face Ilja Dragunov for the NXT Title at Halloween Havoc Night 2 on October 31st.</p><p>The October 10th episode of WWE NXT brought an overnight viewership of 921,000, with a .30 in the 18 to 40 demographic. <a href=#>AEW Dynamite brought in 609,000 viewers</a> for their Title Tuesday episode that ran on the same night. The October 3rd episode of WWE NXT brought in an overnight average of 857,000 viewers, and a .22 in the 18 to 40 demographic. This was the fallout after No Mercy.</p><p>We will continue covering WWE’s activity in NXT, and the entire pro wrestling world all around it, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
