The same goes for Daredevil: Born Again, another upcoming project <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining a lot of interest</a>. And we all know everyone’s waiting on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man 4 to web its way to theaters</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>You’ve got to wonder, then… And forgive the incoming Watcher impression but… What if Marvel were to cancel the much-troubled Avengers 5 and swap it for another team-up event that could excite the fandom even more? Namely, a project to bring together Marvel’s own “Team Red” — Deadpool, Daredevil, and Spider-Man? Sadly, it’s just a pipe dream for now, but let’s just live in the fantasy land where it’s actually happening for a moment, shall we?</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>As created by Junk Edits, the following fan poster pitches a Marvel Studios movie called Code Red, in which Ryan Reynolds, Charlie Cox, and Tom Holland come together, alongside two other red-suited superheroes — Simu Liu’s Shang-Chi and Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man. When sharing the artwork on Reddit, the creator asked who should be the villain of such a film. “Omega Red, obviously!” declared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one Redditor</a>, proving they need to be hired to write the screenplay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Updated.

Team Red is the name given to the dream assembled trio of Spider-Man, Deadpool, and Daredevil. While Spider-Man and Deadpool have teamed up many times in the comics, Matt Murdock being thrown into the mix hasn’t really occurred outside of the comic Deadpool: Suicide Kings. Nevertheless, fans are obsessed with the idea of these three very different heroes coming together.</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Given all the excitement surrounding Deadpool & Wolverine and Born Again, clearly it would be in Marvel’s best interests to make Team Red an official thing in the MCU before long. Honestly, as Avengers 5 is unlikely to go anywhere — despite the fact <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it remains without a director or a lead villain</a> — maybe the best bet would be to build Spider-Man 4 around Team Red. That would be one way to one-up, or at least equal, the thrill of Holland <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meeting Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield</a>.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Team Red remains a pipe-dream for now, but if the next few phases come and go without DD, DP, and Spidey hanging out then Marvel will be left severely red-faced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqqppq5bsPOrqOdZaOau6V50qGmnKOnlsOmv4ytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSmm6Vitqd5yK1krJuilr2xscNmmK%2Bdnpyys7%2BMbmSfp6Jiwam10mapnpxdnby1ecKrpqyrn6uys3nMqK2inV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mad-men-review-runaways-season-7-episode-5.html><span>←</span><span>Mad Men Review: The Runaways (Season 7, Episode 5)</span></a>
