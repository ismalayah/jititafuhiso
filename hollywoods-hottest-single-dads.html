But that's just genetics, and we are more curious as to how the actor has been able to maintain his killer bod and his smooth skin as a single father of three. Parenting is, after all, stressful even in the best of scenarios. Even if Marsden does not have the wrinkles to show for it, he appears to be a hands-on dad who puts fatherhood at the top of his list of priorities. "Of all my achievements in life, being a father is the one thing I'm most proud of. It is the most fulfilling," he told <a href=#>Men's Health</a> in 2018. "I'm always self-deprecating, but I don't have a problem saying that I am a great dad."</p><p>Marsden shares his two older children with his ex-wife Lisa Linde, to whom he was married from 2000 to 2011. The couple welcomed son Jack Holden in 2001, and daughter Mary James four years after that. Marsden had a third child, son William Luca, with ex-girlfriend Rose Costa, though their short-lived relationship had already ended by the time of William's birth in December 2012. While he has been in a relationship with singer-songwriter Emma Deign since 2015, Marsden is unmarried and, therefore, a single dad. Is he a cool dad, though? Well, maybe. "My kids have always been in the best way, kind of wonderfully underwhelmed with what I do," Marsden told <a href=#>People</a> in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthboZ0hY6hpqWkqay8sLDSZp%2BorKSawLV50qKloKSVYrGisNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beautiful-o-b.html><span>←</span><span>Beautiful O.B</span></a>
