I'm sorry to report: that's pretty much all he does. As in a lot of latter-day Seagal vehicles, Seagal is barely in the film. These days, he&nbsp;often&nbsp;plays villains, though&nbsp;he almost&nbsp;never&nbsp;allows himself to cut loose, and be memorably nasty (I hear "<a href=#>Machete Kills</a>" is fun). So the above-mentioned&nbsp;tap on the bum is gentle, but ostentatious. Which wouldn't be so icky if Seagal&nbsp;had not been, in real life, repeatedly&nbsp;accused of&nbsp;<a href=# class=m_-8584706667671856110OWAAutoLink id=m_-8584706667671856110LPlnk615014 data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/20/steven-seagal-accused-of-raping-an-18-year-old-adding-to-decades-of-claims-against-the-actor/?noredirect%3Don%26utm_term%3D.28c93d64c24b&source=gmail&ust=1528993433294000&usg=AFQjCNEOF8TINfRS1URa3ye3yvAklZ-q4A">rape</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# class=m_-8584706667671856110OWAAutoLink id=m_-8584706667671856110LPlnk701664 data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/03/19/two-steven-seagal-accusers-detail-allegations-rape-sexual-assault-actor/438533002/&source=gmail&ust=1528993433294000&usg=AFQjCNH6KrOC8xNQ5hJ_CO8UP99d526zZg">sexual assault</a>. It's almost as if he threw in a little sexual harassment into this film&nbsp;just so he could&nbsp;thumb his nose at any&nbsp;American critics who expect more from him and/or still remember him.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;<a href=# class=m_-8584706667671856110OWAAutoLink id=m_-8584706667671856110LPlnk789897 data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/mike-tyson-rap-sheet-1.308253&source=gmail&ust=1528993433294000&usg=AFQjCNFtQNpeKilqv2p_xK8wmY1ebhhl8A">rape and sexual battery</a>: Tyson's equally problematic appearance is also&nbsp;light to the point of being distractingly under-developed. Kabbah's&nbsp;an antiheroic heavy who takes a swing at Lauder&nbsp;simply&nbsp;because Lauder insists that Kabbah have a drink with him (and because the film's posters need some action to sell). But Kabbah, like Susanna, eventually is allowed&nbsp;a humanizing moment or two, a fine idea that is executed&nbsp;with&nbsp;a pachyderm's&nbsp;grace&nbsp;when&nbsp;Tyson—moving&nbsp;robotically, and mumbling his way through lines that he clearly recorded during a post-production&nbsp;recording session—says something vague about "my faith" and "my tribe." This may prompt you to yell back at the screen "Which tribe? Whose faith?" But I digress.</p><p>Still, if&nbsp;you—like me—are a reluctant Seagal completist, you might say to yourself: cram it, Simon Abrams,&nbsp;this movie sounds like dumb fun! Friends, let me assure you: we&nbsp;deserve better. Like chocolate babka,&nbsp;"China Salesman" is&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;crummy, no matter which way&nbsp;you slice it. The film's&nbsp;nature as a work of&nbsp;propaganda would be more deplorable—or at least eyeroll-inducing—if it weren't so poorly blocked, scripted, performed, and choreographed. There is no joy in Seagal-ville, dear rubber-neckers,&nbsp;because pretty much everybody here&nbsp;has struck out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cn6KmkWLAorjErKSapl1nfXKE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruno-sammartino-biography-wikipedia-net-worth-wife-children-dead-funeral.html><span>←</span><span>Bruno Sammartino Biography, Wikipedia, Net Worth, Wife, Children, Dead, Funeral</span></a>
