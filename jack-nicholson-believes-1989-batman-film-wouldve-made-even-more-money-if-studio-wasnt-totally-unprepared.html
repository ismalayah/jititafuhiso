Some of the other actors point out how his addition to the film suddenly made people take the movie seriously. Nicholson himself praises Tim Burton and easily opens up about his time working on the movie.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>It’s impossible not to feel as if Nicholson thoroughly enjoyed giving his time and being interviewed for the documentary, and often has humorous or noteworthy things to say.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>However, one of his claims is rather surprising and, after some further digging in an attempt to back his claim, it might actually stun some fans of the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>At one point, Nicholson — who is extremely humble throughout the doc — talks about whether the studio realized how successful the movie was going to be.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Jack says, “I knew how big it was going to be. I knew this. For instance, they (Warner Bros. studio) had a good feeling about it,” then later adds, “but they were totally unprepared for the level of the success of the movie.”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>The documentary, which is presented rather well, actually doesn’t follow-up on Nicholson’s statement right away. Instead, later on, they cut back to Nicholson’s interview and that’s when we get to see the actor’s explanation.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>“Every bit of Joker product and paraphernalia sold before the movie was released. They were out. They could’ve sold billions and billions more of these things.”</p><p>Nicholson adds that because of all the extreme hype, the level of which few expected, the successful merchandise sales can also be seen as something of a missed opportunity. “They had more customers than they had product for this particular movie.”</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>It seems like a minor thing to claim, but Nicholson may have a bigger point than you would think upon first hearing someone say that Batman — whose merchandising is now considered legendary — could have made a lot more money. Before I explain why, consider how popular the merchandise was.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>As others note in the doc, the marketing was exceptional and the merchandise was everywhere. Producer Mark Canton said, “People were buying the Batman ties, the t-shirts, the hats, the cuff links, the underwear, everything.”</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>Director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Burton</a> didn’t realize how big the hype was until, he explains, “I saw the Batman cereal. That’s when it hit me.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>However, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a> in 1991, the film had made $253 million at the box office up to that point but was still $35 million short of making a profit.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Here’s the eye-opening line from that article which refers to net-profits from merchandise sales: “According to the studio, Batman merchandise featuring the ubiquitous Batman logo (T-shirts, toys, posters, etc) only yielded $2.9 million.”</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>That directly contradicts other claims, some of which place the number as high as $500 million, albeit in gross sales. In 1992, The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NY Times</a> claimed about the original film, “A flood of licensed merchandise, from T-shirts to Batman cereal, generated an additional $500 million in retail sales.”</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Unlike the NY Times, however, the LA Times provides a detailed breakdown of other contracts and profits from the film, suggesting their number about the merchandise is closer to being accurate. They also claim to have obtained the numbers directly from the studio, whereas the NY Times does not reference where their number came from.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>If true — that the original Batman merchandise earned such a low net profit — then Nicholson emphasizing that the studio could have made significantly more money from it might surprisingly be an extremely valid point.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>It’s worth adding that he does say in the documentary that — in regards to the Joker merchandise selling out so quickly without being able to produce more of it quickly enough — it cost him money or, as he light-heartedly concluded, “I don’t care,” with a Joker-esque grin, “but it also cost me some dough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqbm2K7qq%2FHqKOsp55ir6a4yJ6tnqtdZoZ5hYybmK2lkaN6p7XLpmSwp6WhsbexjKaYnZ1dmsOmuoympqudXaK8r7HYZqCfZaOpwqW1zmaumqueqXq1u9Oao6WxXaq7sb7EqZirnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-reality-show-you-never-knew-kristen-wiig-was-on.html><span>←</span><span>The Reality Show You Never Knew Kristen Wiig Was On</span></a>
