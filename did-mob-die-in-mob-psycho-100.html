The series is one of the most popular anime of 2022, but everything must come to an end, even the best, which is why the ending of the latest episode left fans completely stunned.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Shigeo Kageyama – nicknamed Mob – is a seemingly typical teenage boy who actually has immense psychic abilities. He’s the most powerful human on the planet, but has one weakness – he’s too shy and awkward to confess his feelings to the girl he likes.</p><p data-characters=749 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>In Season 3, Episode 9’s “Mob 1 ~Moving~,” Shigeo discovers Tsubomi will be moving away and transferring schools. Realizing now is finally the time to shoot his shot, he makes plans to meet her at the park they used to play at together as children. With a bouquet of flowers in hand, Mob walks to the street corner to cross, where he saves a black cat from being hit by a car. As the crossing light flashes, he and another boy – distracted by a video game – cross the street. Unfortunately, a tired driver speeding down the road isn’t paying attention. The boy’s video game goes flying through the air, but as the camera pans down, the boy is safe, while Mob lies in the middle of the street with his flowers, blood pooling around him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mob-Psycho-100-Mob-Dies_.jpg><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Mob sacrificed himself for another kid, but with three episodes left, that can’t be the end, right? Fans took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> to voice their concerns over the final moments of the anime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mob-Psycho-Reddit.jpg><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Luckily, the same events played out in the manga, which concluded in December 2017 with 101 chapters, so some people know what is coming in the final few episodes of the anime.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning: If you don’t want any future spoilers, stop reading now.</strong></p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Good news – he’s alive. Bad news – the accident causes Mob to lose control of his psychic abilities, which he has been able to keep mostly at bay. The release of so much psychic power results in catastrophic damage to the city. Every single step he takes causes earthquakes, the electrical grid goes haywire and he destroys everything in his path.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Of course, he’ll be alright by the end, but after hiding his full potential for so long and then accidentally unleashing it, Shigeo may never be the same.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Catch up on Mob Psycho 100 or watch the remaining episodes on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6doJ1lnaSvbrDInmSipl2ivKN5z6ywnKCfYn5xfI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-mcelhenney-who-is-rob-mcelhenney-sister.html><span>←</span><span>Katie McElhenney: Who Is Rob McElhenney sister?</span></a>
