Unsurprisingly, every single live-action outing ought to have its fair share of cynics <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">skeptical about the existence of an adaptation altogether</a>, but it appears that Peter Pan & Wendy might have hit the mark when it comes to the perfect cast this time around. Anchored by Alexander Molony (The Bad Seed Returns) as Peter Pan, the actor is accompanied by perhaps an unfamiliar face portraying Wendy.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-playing-wendy-in-peter-pan-wendy data-injectable=false>Who is playing Wendy in ‘Peter Pan & Wendy’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ever Anderson (@everanderson)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>The actress bringing Wendy to life in Peter Pan & Wendy is Ever Anderson. Perhaps foreign to some, Anderson’s name or face might be recognizable to many others. In 2021, the 15-year-old portrayed a young Natasha in Black Widow, perhaps much more discernible with her blue hair as the aspiring spy. Four years prior, Anderson had her film debut in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, where she played a Young Alicia, co-starring in the film alongside her mother, Milla Jovovich.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Born in 2007, Anderson entered the industry at a fairly young age. At just nine years old, albeit right next to her mom, Anderson kickstarted her career, likely under the keen eye of her progenitors. With a knack for acting, clearly deriving from her parents Jovovich and Paul W.S. Anderson, the young girl is quickly skyrocketing in Hollywood, making a name for herself outside of her parents’ limelight.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Peter Pan & Wendy is currently available on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXaW5osXSZq6eppSueqq6jKmcrZ2iYr2iuoywnKecqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dr-darrin-porcher-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Dr Darrin Porcher Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</span></a>
