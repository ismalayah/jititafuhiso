<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans movie review (2009)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In the gallery of bad cops, Terence McDonagh belongs in the first room. Everyone will think of Harvey Keitel's lieutenant in <a href=#>Abel Ferrara</a>'s masterpiece "<a href=#>Bad Lieutenant</a>" (1993) for the obvious reason. I hope this film inspires you to seek out that one. It deserves to be sought. Ferrara is Shakespearean in his tragedy, Herzog more like <a href=#>Cormac McCarthy</a>. Sometimes on the road to hell you can't help but laugh.</p><p>In a city deserted by many of its citizens and much of its good fortune, McDonagh roams the midnight streets without supervision. He Serves and Protects himself. He is the Law, and the Law exists for his personal benefit. Lurking in his prowler outside a nightclub, he sees a young couple emerge and follows them to an empty parking lot. He stops them, searches them, finds negligible drugs on the man, begins the process of arrest. The man pleads. He's afraid his father will find out. He offers a bribe. McDonagh isn't interested in money. He wants the drugs and the girl, whom he rapes, excited that her boyfriend is watching.</p><p>The film's only similarities with the Ferrara film are in the title and the presentation of a wholly immoral drug addict. It's not what a movie is about but how it's about it. Ferrara regards his lieutenant without mercy. Herzog can be as forgiving as God. An addict in need can be capable of about anything. He will betray family, loved ones, duty, himself. He's driven. Because addiction is an illness (although there is debate), we mustn't be too quick to judge. Drugs and alcohol are both terrible, but drugs can drive a victim more urgently to ruin.</p><p>Herzog shows McDonagh lopsided from back pain. He begins with prescription Vicodin and moves quickly to cocaine. As a cop, he develops sources. He steals from other addicts and from dealers. In the confusion after Katrina, he steals from a police evidence room. <a href=#>George Carlin</a> said, "What does cocaine feel like? It makes you feel like some more cocaine."</p><p>McDonagh has a girlfriend named Frankie (<a href=#>Eva Mendes</a>). She's a hooker. He's OK with this. He gives her drugs, she sometimes has them for him. They share something an addict craves: sympathy and understanding. They stand together against the horrors. He's also close to his 60-ish father, Pat (<a href=#>Tom Bower</a>), not close to Pat's 40-ish partner Genevieve (<a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge</a>). His father has a history with AA. Genevieve is a bosomy all-day beer drinker. They live in a slowly decaying rural manse somewhere in the parish. Pat knows what to look for in his son and sees it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bmJ1lnJ6ytsDEp5inrF2lvLPAjKidZpuRobluusSwZKiqnJqur7%2BMa2dpcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-rylee-arnold-the-new-dancing-with-the-stars-pro-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rylee Arnold?
