And while viewers may be taken with Bell’s signature charm or the script’s jabs at overplayed plot points, many readers are wondering whether Anna’s illness is a real thing or just another nod and wink at genre shortcomings.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning, mild spoilers follow below.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Firstly, yes, Virginia, there is a legitimate phobia of the rain called Ombrophobia. But it didn’t originally apply to humans. The term was first coined by Viennese botanist Julius Weisner in the 19th century and was used to denote plants that do not thrive under rainy conditions. The name derives from “ombros,” meaning thunderstorm, and “phobos,” meaning fear. The term was later adopted as a psychological term to refer to individuals with an irrational fear of rain.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>In The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window,&nbsp;Anna is a once successful artist who has been traumatized by the death of her daughter and spiraled into drug and alcohol dependency. She’s also, for the purposes of the satire, a virtual shut-in who regularly spies on her neighbors. And as an ombrophobic, she can’t stand to be out in the rain.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>Ombrophobia manifests differently depending on the sufferer. Some will only be triggered if they are caught in a downpour, whereas some will go to extreme lengths to avoid even being out on a cloudy day. In some rare cases, even the mere mention of rain can cause a person to succumb to panic attacks. All ombrophobics will suffer some amount of anxiety in connection with rain, and some can even experience increased heart rate, increased breathing, raised blood pressure, muscle tension, trembling, and excessive sweating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristen-bell-woman-in-the-house-1.jpg><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>Anna’s ombrophobia, like many cases, is caused by personal trauma, in this case, the death of her daughter when it was raining. Since the death, Anna has left her painting career behind and is unable to leave the house if there’s even rain in the forecast – and yes, it obviously rains a lot throughout the series. However, real ombrophobia isn’t always caused by trauma, although it can be. Psychiatrists believe genetic and environmental factors may also play a part in the ailment’s development.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>As such, treatment can vary. According to <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych Times</a></strong>, treatments can include Exposure Therapy, where the sufferer is slowly exposed to rain over time with the help of medical and counseling professionals, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and even Yoga. Psychiatric drug therapies such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication can also alleviate the illness.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>As for whether Anna manages to find a cure…or a murderer, you’ll just have to watch The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window to find out. All eight episodes are currently available for viewing on Netflix.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yopJuqn6W1sK7ImmSrnZGheqy%2ByKyrnqZdl7KtuNJmpZ6vXaOytbLLoq9mq5Wntqa%2FjKGYrGWimq6lsdGsZKCnn5y5qrrGZp2oql2eu6e7jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-tennant-michael-sheen-good-omens.html><span>←</span><span>David Tennant Rocks Red Hair In Another New Good Omens Photo</span></a>
