“Love” is a big word and an even bigger concept. Its abstractness has provided a rich soil for history’s most enduring art. Its definition is arguable, so some might not even find the movies on this list romantic at all, but, like it or not, it is also comprehensive, so that even the wildest movie that you can think of right now can somehow also be labeled as a love story.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brie Larson may have MODOKs butt hole to blame if The Marvels ends up tanking as bad as</h2><time>May 5, 2024</time>

Unfortunately, Brie Larson has had to deal with a lot of a**holes over her time in the MCU so far, thanks to the endless yammerings of misogynistic morons online, but the most problematic to date may have just shimmied its way into view. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is proving to be far from the grand Phase Five opener we were all hoping for, turning out to be less of a dramatic debut for Jonathan Majors’ Kang and more of a showcase for Marvel’s worst impulses, like the need to show us M.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Disney+'s Percy Jackson and the Olympians is Nice, Safe, and Fun | TV/Streaming</h2><time>May 5, 2024</time>

From there, viewers should expect a show that adheres to the tween television form. For example, “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” modulates between warm, network-style lighting (everyone looks great!) to overly dark action sequences (can you follow what’s happening without turning up the brightness on your screen?). It’s not inspiring stuff but the aesthetic gets more enjoyable with the arrival of mythological creatures: a subtle set of horns here, a magic baseball cap there.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brawl For All Episode Of Dark Side Of The Ring Pulls In Over 200,000 Viewers</h2><time>May 4, 2024</time>

The latest episode of VICELAND’s Dark Side Of The Ring tackled the infamous Brawl For All from 1998 and packed quite a punch in the viewership.

Recommended Videos The “previously on” clips that kicked off “The Runaways” showed various characters speak about Don as crazy and impulsive, followed by the mandate from the agency partners to “stick to the script.” Don rebelled against the protocol at the end of season six and the powers in the office still think he has the urge to strike again. Don is slowly turning into a more independent character than we have seen, obedient at work but with a sour streak starting to build from within that could see a major shift in his rapport with the company in the next few episodes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Marvel would send shockwaves through the MCU if it scrapped Avengers 5 for this red-hot crosso</h2><time>May 4, 2024</time>

Dwindling interest in the MCU‘s Multiverse Saga has reached such a point that we’re not entirely sure a new Avengers movie could restore the franchise to its former world-conquering glory. “But, hold on,” you might be thinking, imaginary opinionated reader, “didn’t Deadpool 3 just break records to become the most-viewed trailer on YouTube?” While that is true, it’s fair to say Deadpool & Wolverine stands somewhat apart from the wider saga.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is LaLa Milan?</h2><time>May 4, 2024</time>
