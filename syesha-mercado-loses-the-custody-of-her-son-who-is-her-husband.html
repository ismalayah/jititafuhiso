Likewise, Tyron Deener and Sayesha Mercado are even parents to a son named Amen’Ra and an infant daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Deener is an educator and youth service professional. He is currently working in the foster care system.&nbsp;</p><p>Syesha Mercado is an American, singer, songwriter and actress. She came into prominence as the third finalist at American Idol season 7.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Syesha also starred in the lead role of Deena Jones in the Dreamgirls national tour of 2009.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=update-on-syesha-mercado-children-and-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=update-on-syesha-mercado-children-and-family></span>Update on Syesha Mercado Children and Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Syesha Mercado is currently fighting for her children custody.</p><p>On Wednesday, Syesha’s newly born daughter was allegedly taken away by Manatee County officers. Apparently, the officials took custody of the baby to bring her to a hospital for examination. However, the singer has described the act as “legalized kidnapping”.&nbsp;</p><p>Syesha Mercado even posted a video of the incident on her Instagram @syesha. The hour-long clip, which has over 1.7 million views, features Mercado fighting with the police to secure her baby.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second time Syesha Mercado’s family was taken away from her.</p><p>More than three weeks ago, 15 months old Amen’Ra was taken away by authorities with allegations of malnutrition. The officials claimed that the parents refused the B12 shot to the child- which Syesha claims is not true.</p><p>Amen’Ra was reportedly put in foster care. And, Mercado and Deener are still fighting to bring back their son.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=syesha-mercado-net-worth-explored><span class=ez-toc-section id=syesha-mercado-net-worth-explored></span>Syesha Mercado Net Worth Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Syesha Mercado net worth has taken a major toll after her legal battle.</p><p>In response, Syesha Mercado even set up a GoFundMe account to pay her lawsuit bills. The page was initially titled “The Legalized Kidnapping of Black Babies Through CPS” and now has been changed to “Bring Ra Home”.</p><p>The profile had initially set a target of $200,000 USD goal. It has already exceeded the sum by over $280,000 in the account.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the Manatee County Sheriff has not released any official statements yet. We are still waiting for their side of the story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKupmsCprYymnKubkZm8brjOrJysZaSdsm6v1KyrqJypYryneceeqWarn6N6uLTOZqCsZZiav2601KyZmqaUZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-phan.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Phan- Biography, Age, Net worth, Height, Weight, Career</span></a>
