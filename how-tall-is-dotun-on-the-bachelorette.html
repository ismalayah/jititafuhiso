That’s simply not true. However, anyone who hasn’t swooned looking up at a beautiful man just simply doesn’t understand the allure tall men possess.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Take <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dotun Obuleko</strong></a> from season 20 of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a></strong>, for example. We fell under his spell the moment he stepped out of the limousine due to his candidly romantic speech and immediate self-awareness. It’s not all about height, though. The man is a walking teddy bear, so you’ve got the unicornian combo of a tall, attractive man with a heart of gold. (Um, Charity, you payin’ attention?)&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=true>During Dotun and Charity’s one-on-one date in Week 4, we fell even more in love with this Nigerian-American native as we watched him peel back one layer after another. Charity even said he “touches her soul.” But the unfolding love story between the pair took a back seat at times due to the stark height difference that commanded our attention. It’s that hard not to notice. For the record, Charity is 5’3”, so most people look tall next to her, but Dotun? Well, let’s just say most people look short next to him.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wait-dotun-is-how-tall data-injectable=false>Wait, Dotun is how tall?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>There’s been a lot of tall men in Bachelor Nation. Even our host Jesse Palmer is 6’2” but he pales in comparison to Dotun. Want to take a guess? Go ahead…</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Accept This Rose</a>, Dotun is 6’7”, making him the tallest contestant in Bachelorette history and most assuredly the tallest man this season. It’s no wonder <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brayden chose to start beef with Aaron instead of Dotun</a>. (It’s worth noting, however, that Aaron is no pipsqueak either; the man is 6’5” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tulane University</a>, but I digress.)&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>At 30 years old, Doton works as an Integrative Medicine Specialist. Although he hasn’t elaborated on what his specific job title entails, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleveland Clinic</a>, integrative medicine physicians “work together with all members of your healthcare team to heal your mind, body and spirit.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Again, height isn’t everything. But a man who is kind, attractive, emotionally intelligent, emotionally available, and tall? Well, you’ve got yourself a husband right there.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG6wzq2sp2Wfo3q1tMRmmZqbmJq5sL7EraueZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eyimofe-this-is-my-desire-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Eyimofe (This Is My Desire) movie review (2021)</span></a>
