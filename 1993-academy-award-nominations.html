<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>1993 Academy Award Nominations | Festivals &amp;amp; Awards</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In best supporting actor, the big surprise was Davidson of "The Crying Game," whose real sex was kept a secret by millions of moviegoers until the Academy announcement made it obvious. If he wins in the category, he will join <a href=#>Linda Hunt</a>, a woman who played a man in "Year of Living Dangerously" (1983). Other nominees are <a href=#>Gene Hackman</a>, as the sadistic sheriff in "Unforgiven," Jack Nicholson, winning his tenth nomination, as the savage Marine commandant in "A Few Good Men;" Pacino, as one of the embittered real estate salesmen in "<a href=#>Glengarry Glen Ross</a>," and newcomer <a href=#>David Paymer</a>, who played the long-suffering brother of a stand-up comic in "<a href=#>Mr. Saturday Night</a>." A notable omission was <a href=#>Jack Lemmon</a>, in "Glengarry Glen Ross."</p><p>For best supporting actress, the nominees were <a href=#>Judy Davis</a>, as a wife who determines to get divorced in <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>'s "<a href=#>Husbands and Wives</a>;" <a href=#>Joan Plowright</a>, as one of a group of British women who go on an Italian holiday in "Enchanted April;" <a href=#>Vanessa Redgrave</a>, winning her sixth nomination, as the first wife of the hypocritical banker in "Howard's End;" <a href=#>Miranda Richardson</a>, as the wife of an adulterous cabinet minister in "<a href=#>Damage</a>;" and <a href=#>Marisa Tomei</a>, as the ditzy girl friend of a would-be legal hotshot in "<a href=#>My Cousin Vinny</a>." Overlooked by voters was the fine work of <a href=#>Alfre Woodard</a> in "Passion Fish," and Rosie Perez's career-making work in "<a href=#>White Men Can't Jump</a>."</p><p>Best director nods went to <a href=#>Neil Jordan</a>, for "The Crying Game;" <a href=#>James Ivory</a>, for "Howard's End;" Robert Altman, for "The Player;" <a href=#>Martin Brest</a>, for "Scent of a Woman," and Clint Eastwood, for "Unforgiven." The Director's Guild of America awards, widely seen as a predictor of the Oscars in this category, nominated <a href=#>Rob Reiner</a> for "A Few Good Men" instead of Brest. The obvious exclusion in the category was <a href=#>Spike Lee</a>, for "Malcolm X," a film many Academy voters possibly did not chose to see.</p><p>In the Best Documentary category, where the Academy's dysfunctional selection committee has made an annual practice of not naming the year's best candidates, there was another scandalous exclusion this year. "<a href=#>Brother's Keeper</a>," the most successful and best-reviewed documentary of the year, was passed over. One interesting choice: "Fires of Kuwait" was the first Oscar nominee to be shot in the huge-screen IMAX process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52jqba3rcusZmpxaWh6oq%2FAnZymsV2WxKK%2Bw2alqKWZo661tc6nqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lacombe-lucien-1974.html><span>←</span><span>Lacombe, Lucien movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1974)</span></a>
